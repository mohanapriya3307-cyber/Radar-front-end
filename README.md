Solutions of Problems Using Smith Chart in Radar Front-End Systems (SWR, Reflection Coefficient, Impedance Matching)

Introduction to Radar Front-End Problem
---

In a 77 GHz automotive radar, the PA output must deliver maximum power to the transmit antenna.
But the antenna impedance is rarely exactly 50 Ω at all frequencies. Even a small mismatch leads to:

Reduced transmitted power

Increased reflected wave → overheating of PA

Distortion in radar chirps

Reduced detection range

Typical mismatch example:

Power Amplifier Output Impedance: 50 Ω

Radar Patch Antenna Impedance at 77 GHz: 38 + j12 Ω

This mismatch must be solved using a Smith Chart.
